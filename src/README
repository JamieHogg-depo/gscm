		shared_latent_rho_fixed: 0, specific_latent_rho_fixed: 0: GOOD CONVERGENCE 
		
		shared_latent_rho_fixed: 1, specific_latent_rho_fixed: 0: GOOD CONVERGENCE
		
		shared_latent_rho_fixed: 1, specific_latent_rho_fixed: 1: Poor efficiency but okay convergence 
			- some max treedepth problems
			- all saved parameters have Rhat < 1.01
		
		shared_latent_rho_fixed: 2, specific_latent_rho_fixed: 0: Poor efficiency but okay convergence 
			- 0.4% of saved parameters have Rhat > 1.01
			- The alpha parameters exhibit poor convergence
			- this is most likely to do with rho being so close to 1
			- GOOD LOO
			
		shared_latent_rho_fixed: 2, specific_latent_rho_fixed: 2: Poor efficiency but okay convergence
			- 10% of saved parameters have Rhat > 1.01
			- The alpha and rho parameters exhibit poor convergence
			- the latent factors must soak up most of the spatial patterns making 
			the feature-specific terms IID
			- 4 divergent transitions
			- GOOD LOO
			
		shared_latent_rho_fixed: 2, specific_latent_rho_fixed: 0: 
			- using 4 chains
			- using init = 0
			- 12.9% of saved parameters have Rhat > 1.01
			- The alpha parameters exhibit poor convergence
			- this is most likely to do with rho being so close to 1
			- GOOD LOO
		
	Using ps_state = 6 (97 areas) and L = 1
		shared_latent_rho_fixed: 2, specific_latent_rho_fixed: 2: Poor efficiency but okay convergence
				- 0.16% of saved parameters have Rhat > 1.01
				- The alpha and rho parameters exhibit poor convergence
				- GOOD LOO
				
		shared_latent_rho_fixed: 2, specific_latent_rho_fixed: 0: (using 4 chains)
			- terrible convergence
			- found 2 modes - only one chain did this
			- other chains converged nicely
			
	Using all areas and L = 2
		took 62 mins
		shared_latent_rho_fixed: 2, specific_latent_rho_fixed: 0: (using 4 chains)
			- 14 observations have very bad pareto
			- alpha has not converged - possibly because rho is 0.99 for both latent factors
			- when alpha has not converged then the z's also don't
			- 28% of saved parameters have Rhat  > 1.01

# 0816 - entirety of Australia
	GSCM_finalversion.stan
	added soft constraint on LCAR
		- this fixes the issues with alpha
	activity has the strongest PCA loading with PC1
	alcohol has the stongest PCA loading with PC2
	Order should be activityleiswkpl, alcohol, etc
	11 observations have very bad LOO values
	Takes 90 minutes to fit

	GSCM_nome_finalversion.stan - copied from GSCM_finalversion.stan file
	
	Use gamma(2,1) priors for both std terms
	drop feature-specific terms - assume normal for each feature
		- terrible convergence
		- found two modes!

	GSCM_nome2_finalversion.stan - copied from GSCM_finalversion.stan file
	By marginally scaling the matrix to have a std of 1 we fix 1 in the ME model
	This way we can use the non-mean centered parameterisation
	This has made the model unidentifiable as Lambda is just drawing from the priors
	All the variance has been soaked up by the fixed std of 1. 
	Took 18 mins (not in parallel)
	Most of the hyperpriors are just sampling from the priors
