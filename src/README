		shared_latent_rho_fixed: 0, specific_latent_rho_fixed: 0: GOOD CONVERGENCE 
		
		shared_latent_rho_fixed: 1, specific_latent_rho_fixed: 0: GOOD CONVERGENCE
		
		shared_latent_rho_fixed: 1, specific_latent_rho_fixed: 1: Poor efficiency but okay convergence 
			- some max treedepth problems
			- all saved parameters have Rhat < 1.01
		
		shared_latent_rho_fixed: 2, specific_latent_rho_fixed: 0: Poor efficiency but okay convergence 
			- 0.4% of saved parameters have Rhat > 1.01
			- The alpha parameters exhibit poor convergence
			- this is most likely to do with rho being so close to 1
			- GOOD LOO
			
		shared_latent_rho_fixed: 2, specific_latent_rho_fixed: 2: Poor efficiency but okay convergence
			- 10% of saved parameters have Rhat > 1.01
			- The alpha and rho parameters exhibit poor convergence
			- the latent factors must soak up most of the spatial patterns making 
			the feature-specific terms IID
			- 4 divergent transitions
			- GOOD LOO
			
		shared_latent_rho_fixed: 2, specific_latent_rho_fixed: 0: 
			- using 4 chains
			- using init = 0
			- 12.9% of saved parameters have Rhat > 1.01
			- The alpha parameters exhibit poor convergence
			- this is most likely to do with rho being so close to 1
			- GOOD LOO
		
	Using ps_state = 6 (97 areas) and L = 1
		shared_latent_rho_fixed: 2, specific_latent_rho_fixed: 2: Poor efficiency but okay convergence
				- 0.16% of saved parameters have Rhat > 1.01
				- The alpha and rho parameters exhibit poor convergence
				- GOOD LOO
				
		shared_latent_rho_fixed: 2, specific_latent_rho_fixed: 0: (using 4 chains)
			- terrible convergence
			- found 2 modes - only one chain did this
			- other chains converged nicely
